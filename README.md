This is a collection of my answers to the exercises in [Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html).

## Languages

I mainly tried to use Elm 0.18 to answer the questions, but sometimes had to use Scheme for some exercises, for example when defining a function with an arbitary amount of parameters.

Now that Elm 0.19 is released, maybe I should move to elm 0.19. ShouldI separate my elm 0.18 and 0.19 code then into folders? probably.
