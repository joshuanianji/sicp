This is a collection of my answers to the exercises in [Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html).

## Languages

I mainly tried to use Elm 0.18 to answer the questions, but sometimes had to use Scheme for some exercises, for example when defining a function with an arbitary amount of parameters.

Now that Elm 0.19 is released, maybe I should move to elm 0.19. Should I separate my Elm 0.18 and 0.19 code then into different folders? Probably.

**Edit September 7 2018:**
I'm planning to run elm-upgrade or something to change my code to Elm 0.19. The change should be relatively straightforward, I think.
